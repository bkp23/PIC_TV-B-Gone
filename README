Based on the original TV-B-Gone by Lady Ada. Modified and post with permission.

Pros:
  * Has both start and stop buttons
  * More energy efficient
      Uses 80% less power in (deep) sleep mode
      Stop button saves running power
  * External oscillator optional due to PIC's more accurate internal clock
Cons:
  * Programmer is more expensive
Verdict:
  * Use only if you already have access to a programmer

Specific part numbers are just examples. Other parts may work just as
well. Prices are quoted from digikey.com and will be less expensive
in larger quantities. (Prices are probably outdated by the time you
read this, too, but they'll still provide a reference.)


Variants:
  This project was designed to run off of 3V (2-AA batteries) or 4.5V
(3-AA batteries). 4.5V will offer increased power output, but I haven't
tested it.
  Add a junction to pin 1!
